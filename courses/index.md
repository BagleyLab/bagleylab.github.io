# Courses

### BY 101 Introductory Biology I (3 h)

**Pre-requisites:** None.

**Co-requisites:** BY 103.

**Description:** An introduction to the concepts of biology, including cellular structure and function, bioenergetics, 
patterns and mechanisms of inheritance, the processes of evolution, and ecology. Intended for biology 
majors and minors and pre-nursing students.


### BY 332 Ecology (lecture + lab; 4 h)

**Pre-requisites:** BY 101, 102, 103, 104.

**Co-requisites:** MS 112 or higher.

**Description:** Prerequisite or Lecture, laboratory, and field study. The association and distribution of organisms in 
relation to the major environmental factors.

**Overview:** In this course, we explore the wonderful world of **Ecology**. Ecology is the study of the relationships between 
organisms 
and their environment, including interactions that determine the distribution and abundance of species. This course will 
introduce you to the processes influencing individuals to populations, communities, and ecosystems. Different timescales 
are addressed, from brief behavioral events, to historical processes operating over millions of years. During **Lectures**, 
you will learn the principles determining variation in (1) growth, physiology, and reproduction of individual organisms; 
(2) interactions between living organisms and the physical environment (ecosystems); (3) population fluctuations; (4) 
multispecies interactions; (5) community diversity and stability; and (6) global climate, biome structure and distribution, 
and Earth history, as arranged into six Modules. In the **Laboratory**, you will learn about abiotic and biotic factors influencing 
the geographical distributions of species (distributional ecology). Our lab **course-based undergraduate research experience 
(CURE)** will be inserted within a broader project monitoring and predicting the responses of Alabamaâ€™s coastal dune ecosystems 
to climate change and sea-level rise. Student projects will use current methods to construct **ecological niche models (ENMs)** 
to better understand factors influencing the past, present, or future distributions of sandy dune plant species. We will 
discuss the theory and practice of ecological niche modeling, including the applications and management importance of ENMs 
in the face of various threats to species, as well as their broader relevance to ecology and evolution.

### BY 460 Ichthyology (lecture + lab; 4 h)

**Pre-requisites:** BY 332.

**Description:** An overview of the evolution, ecology, behavior, physiology, and conservations of fishes. Preparation and 
presentation of an original library or lab/field research project required. Lecture, laboratory, and field study.

### BY 577 Graduate Seminar in Systematics (2 h)

**Pre-requisites:** Approval of instructor.

**Description:** Presentation, discussion, and analysis of recently published research in systematic biology; independent 
library research required.
