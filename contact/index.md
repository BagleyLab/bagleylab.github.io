# Directions to the Bagley Lab
### The Science Complex at Jacksonville State University can be reached by:  
* #### Car:
  * We are located in McGee Hall at 700 Pelham Rd N, just south of Nisbet St. NW / Bennett Blvd. NE in Jacksonville. There is a large [JSU parking area](http://www.jsu.edu/police/visitors.html) behind the JSU Science Complex, which consists of [Martin Hall](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Martin+Hall/@33.8250025,-85.7625895,17.24z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x888a51e33b16e1cb:0xee129d3bbaa46cad!8m2!3d33.825321!4d-85.763366) and [McGee Science Center](https://www.google.com/maps/place/McGee+Science+Center,+11+Bennett+Blvd+NE,+Jacksonville,+AL+36265/@33.8252479,-85.7626669,19.39z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x888a51e338b045c7:0x3bf46d0e9f77e72!8m2!3d33.825506!4d-85.7627395), just south of Bennett Blvd. NE and north of the [Houston Cole Library](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Houston+Cole+Library,+Pelham+Rd+N,+Jacksonville,+AL+36265/@33.8243251,-85.7633952,19.39z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x888a51fccb6fae8d:0xb6aa9ada3d3fb565!8m2!3d33.8242557!4d-85.7631). Please park in the surface lot and see our Department of Biology secretary, [Mrs. Carrie Hightower](http://www.jsu.edu/biology/faculty/hightower/index.html) for a temporary parking pa.
  * If you are being dropped off (by a rideshare service), then you may also use 11 Bennett Blvd NE, Jacksonville, AL 36265 as the destination address because this is a good side of the building/complex for drop-off.

### Once on campus, proceed to the McGee Science Center:
1. You will have to enter through McGee Science Center through the breezeway between McGee and Martin Hall (red arrow on the map below).
2. But first, stop by the Department of Biology in Rm 242 on the 2nd flor and let the secretary (C. Hightower) know you are present for a meeting with Dr. Justin Bagley. She will call my office (Martin Hall 128 A).
3. Go back downstairs towards the breezeway entrance on the 1st floor.
4. Take the last left hallway before the breezeway entrance doors and Dr. Bagley's office is the first office on the _right_.
5. To visit the Bagley Lab / Ecological and Evolutionary Genetics Laboratory (EEGL), you will exit back out to the breezeway and enter the McGee Science Center, which is the brick building in front of you. 
6. The Bagley Lab is located at McGee 103, at the far right end of the hallway on the 1st floor of the McGee Science Center.
