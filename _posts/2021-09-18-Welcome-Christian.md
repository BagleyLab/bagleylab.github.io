I am pleased to welcome to the Bagley Lab my first Master's student, Christian Braswell, who just joined our group in August. 

Christian comes to us from Mike Sandelâ€™s LAQE lab group at UWA, where he worked on several projects in fish phylogeography and DNA barcoding and directed the outreach program for the lab. In the Bagley Lab, he'll be working on conservation genomics of Alabama's threatened and endangered minnow species.
