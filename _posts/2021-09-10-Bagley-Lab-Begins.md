The Bagley Lab is now officially open for business!

Just recently, during Summer semester (June) of 2021, I formally received my lab space in Rm 103 of the McGee Science Center at Jacksonville State University (JSU). See the [Contact page](http://bagleylab.com/contact/) for additional details on our location and how to contact me.
