description: "Justin C. Bagley is currently an Assistant Professor of Biology in the <a href="http://www.jsu.edu/biology/">Department of Biology</a> at <a href="http://www.jsu.edu/">Jacksonville State University</a>, and an Affiliate Researcher in the <a href="https://biology.vcu.edu">Department of Biology</a> at Virginia Commonwealth University. Instructor for majors/non-majors Introductory Biology I and the graduate Seminar in Systematics; researcher in ecological and evolutionary genetics of animals and plants in North America and the Neotropics; developer of <a href="https://github.com/justincbagley/PIrANHA">PIrANHA</a>, <a href="https://github.com/justincbagley/RADish">RADish</a>, and other repositories for analyzing population genomic and phylogenomic datasets.


After receiving his BS and MSc degrees in <a href="https://bsc.ua.edu">Biology</a> from The University of Alabama in 2004 and 2008, Justin received his PhD in <a href="http://biology.byu.edu">Integrative Biology</a> in 2014, from Brigham Young University for his work on comparative phylogeography and species delimitation in Central American freshwater fishes under <a href="https://lifesciences.byu.edu/Directories/FacultyStaff/ctl/FacultyProfile/mid/5712/NetID/jbj59">Jerry Johnson</a>. He was a Young Talent Fellow postdoc in Brazil's CNPq Science Without Borders program under <a href="">Francisco Langeani</a> and <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Guarino_Colli">Guarino Colli</a> at the <a href="https://unb.br">Universidade de Brasília</a>, 2015–2017, and during 2017 to 2018, he completed a postdoc in <a href="https://www.eckertlab.com/">Andrew Eckert's</a> Plant Evolutionary Genetics Laboratory at <a href="https://www.vcu.edu">Virginia Commonwealth University</a> on the genomics of ecological speciation and local adaptation in southwestern white pine (<i>Pinus strobiformis</i>). From 2018-2020, he served as Postdoctoral Research Associate in Plant Phylogenomics in the <a href="http://www.umsl.edu/~muchhalan/People.html">Muchhala Lab</a> at the <a href="https://www.umsl.edu/~biology/">University of Missouri–St. Louis (UMSL)</a>


Justin is an evolutionary biologist focusing on problems in molecular ecology and biodiversity science – particularly the use of genome-wide SNP and sequence capture data (Hyb-Seq, UCEs) to understand how historical and ecological processes shape the spatial and temporal distributions of biodiversity in freshwater and terrestrial environments. Current <a href="research.html">research</a> projects focus on phylogenomics, molecular phylogeography, speciation, and local adaptation in North American and Neotropical plants (forest trees, Neotropical bellflowers) and freshwater fishes (various Neotropical fish groups, North American suckers).


Justin is a reviewer for <em>Systematic Biology</em>, <em>Molecular Ecology</em>, <em>Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution</em>, <em>PeerJ</em>, <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society B</em>, and a dozen other journals in ecology and evolutionary biology.
