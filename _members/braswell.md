description: "Christian was an undergraduate at [The University of West Alabama](https://www.uwa.edu), where he worked in [The Laboratory of Aquatic Evolution (LAQE)](https://www.sandellab.org) of [Dr. Michael Sandel]() on DNA sequencing, animal husbandry, and other projects (e.g. fieldwork, identification, DNA barcoding, and phylogeography of freshwater fishes), and where he also directed the lab's outreach program. 


He recently moved to Jacksonville in 2021 to start his Master's studies in [Biology](http://www.jsu.edu/biology/) here at JSU under Dr. Bagley. Christian is working 
on the conservation genomics of Blue Shiner (_Cyprinella caerulea_), a minnow species native to the Coosa and Cahaba drainages of the Mobile Basin in Alabama, as well as northwest Georgia and southeastern Tennessee. Blue Shiner are federally listed as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act, and are of conservation concern due to pollution, sedimentation, and other human impacts.
