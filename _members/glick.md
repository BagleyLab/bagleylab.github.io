description: "Macee came to JSU from Anniston High School (Anniston, AL), where she was the Valedictorian of her graduating class. She is currently a sophomore undergraduate student and is majoring in Biology. In the Bagley Lab, Macee is interested in learning more about fishes, ecology, genetics, and integrative taxonomy. Macee has been an active participant in lab meetings this semester and is collaborating on our [PhylogatR](https://phylogatr.org) Global Fish Project. We are excited that she will be starting an independent study project in the lab during Spring 2022 semester.


Outside of the lab, Macee is the President of the [JSU Chapter of The National Society of Leadership and Success (NSLS)](https://www.nsls.org/chapter-details/jacksonville-state-university). In her free time, she enjoys singing (choir), animals (e.g. fishkeeping), and the outdoors."
